# Everything this project needs at boot, in one place: start the
# MicroXRCEAgent bridge, give it a moment to come up, then run the
# GPS check. This is the modern equivalent of the old
# start_micro_ros.sh -- Ubuntu's systemd is what actually calls this
# file at power-on (see project.service), there's no separate "boot
# script slot" this drops into by itself.

# EDIT this line to match your real agent command/device if it changes:
/usr/local/bin/MicroXRCEAgent serial --dev /dev/ttyAMA0 -b 921600 &
AGENT_PID=$!

# Give the agent a few seconds to open the port and come up before
# the GPS check starts looking for topics.
